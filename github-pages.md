GitHub Pages is a feature that allows users to host websites directly from their GitHub repositories. It supports both personal and project sites, making it a versatile tool for developers and organizations.
Overview of GitHub Pages
Types of Sites: There are three main types of GitHub Pages:
User/Organization Pages: These are hosted at username.github.io and are linked to a specific GitHub account or organization. The repository must be named username.github.io, and the content is typically served from the main branch.
Project Pages: These are associated with specific projects and can be found at username.github.io/repository-name. They are stored in the same repository as the project, often in a gh-pages branch or a docs folder within the main branch24.
Hosting: GitHub Pages automatically builds your site from static files whenever you push changes to your repository. It primarily uses Jekyll, a static site generator, allowing for easy integration of templates and themes23.
Setting Up a GitHub Pages Site
Create a Repository: Start by creating a new repository on GitHub.
Push Your Code: Upload your website files (e.g., HTML, CSS) to the repository. Ensure your main entry point is named index.html.
Enable GitHub Pages:
Go to the repository settings.
Select "Pages" from the sidebar.
Choose the branch you want to use as the source (typically main or gh-pages) and save your changes45.
Access Your Site: After enabling GitHub Pages, your site will be available at https://username.github.io/repository-name or https://username.github.io for user pages.
Customization and Features
Using Jekyll: For more advanced features like blogging or templating, you can utilize Jekyll. This allows you to create dynamic pages with minimal effort23.
Custom Domains: You can configure custom domains for your GitHub Pages site, providing more branding options while still using GitHub's infrastructure12.
Continuous Deployment: With GitHub Actions, you can automate the build and deployment process, ensuring that any changes pushed to your repository are reflected on your live site immediately5.
Conclusion
GitHub Pages is an excellent solution for hosting static websites, offering simplicity and integration with version control. Whether for personal projects or organizational documentation, it provides a robust platform for web development without additional hosting costs.
